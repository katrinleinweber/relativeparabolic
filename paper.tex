\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Let $R$ be a commutative unital ring and $\Phi$ be a reduced irreducible root system.
Denote by $G=\G(\Phi, R)$ the split simply-connected Chevalley group of type $\Phi$ over $R$ and let $\E(\Phi, R)$ denote its elementary subgroup, 
 i.\,e. the group generated by root unipotents $t_\alpha(\xi)$, $ $ see~\cite{VP, St78, S}.
For an ideal $I \trianglelefteq R$ we denote by $\G(\Phi, R, I)$ the relative Chevalley group (or the principal congruence subgroup) of level $I$, 
i.\,e. the kernel of the map $\G(\Phi, R)\rightarrow\G(\Phi, R/I)$ induced by the canonical projection.

The main goal of the present paper is to study parabolic factorizations of Chevalley groups and their analogues for principal congruence subgroups $\G(\Phi, R, I)$.
By a parabolic factorization we mean a decomposition of $G$ into a product of several parabolic and unipotent subgroups.
To be more specific, we study relative versions of the following three kinds of decompositions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Gauss decomposition i.\,e. decomposition of the form $\E(\Phi,R)=\B \cdot \U^- \cdot \U$, where $\B$ denotes the standard Borel subgroup,
      and $\U$, $\U^-$ are the unipotent radicals of $\B$ and the opposite Borel subgroup $\B^-$;
\item Bass---Kolster decomposition $G = \Par_i \cdot \U_i^- \cdot \U_i \cdot \U_i^-$, where 
      $\Par_i$ is the maximal parabolic subgroup of $\G$ corresponding to $i$-th vertex of the Dynkin diagram of $\Phi$ and 
      $\U_i$, $\U_i^-$ are the unipotent radicals associated with it;
\item Dennis---Vaserstein decomposition $\E(\Phi, R) = \EP_i \cdot (\U_i^- \cap \U_j^-) \cdot \EP_j$, $i\neq j$.
\end{itemize}
%TODO: Insert some links to VIP's papers :)

There are two main reasons to study parabolic factorizations.
Recall that a number of various factorizations of $\G$ are known over rings having small dimension.
For example, Bruhat decomposition is the key instrument in the study of linear groups over fields, 
 while Gauss decomposition and unitriangular factorizations are useful tools in the study of groups over local rings.
Moreover, for each particular analytic or arithmetic setting there is a special decomposition theorem (Iwasawa, Cartan and Iwahori decompositions, to mention a few).
Unfortunately, neither of these decompositions can be carried over to rings of higher dimension.
The advantage of parabolic factorizations lies in the fact that they remain true for a broader class of rings described in terms of milder ring-theoretic assumptions such as the stable range condition.

Another advantage of parabolic factorizations is that they prove useful in the study of asymptotical properties of Chevalley groups.
The following theorem is the first such application. 
\begin{thm} Let $I$ be an ideal of a commutative ring $R$ such that
\begin{itemize} \item either $\sr(I) = 1$;
 \item or $R = \mathbb{Z}[\sfrac{1}{p}]$ for some prime $p$. \end{itemize}
In the latter case assume additionally that Generalized Riemann Hypothesis holds.
Then for any $\Phi$ the width of the congruence subgroup $\G(\Phi, R, I)$ with respect to $z_\alpha$ does not exceed $C_1|\Phi| + C_2$. \end{thm}
\noindent In the proof of the above theorem we use Bass---Kolster decomposition to reduce to the case $\Phi=\rA_1$ which then can be settled directly.
Notice that the particular case $I=R$ of the above theorem was demonstrated in~\cite{VavSmSuUnitrEng} (see also \cite{VseUnitrZ1p}).

\begin{thm}
Let $\mathcal{O}_S$ be a Dedekind ring of arithmetic type in some global field $k$ having a real embedding. If $\rk\Phi\geqslant2$, then $\G(\Phi,\mathcal{O}_S,I)$ has finite width with respect to $z_\alpha$.
\end{thm}

The second application concerns subsystem factorizations of Chevalley groups formulated in terms of submaximal subgroups of type $\rA_\ell$.
The case when $R=I$ is a field this question was studied by N.~Nikolov in \cite{NikProdDecomp}. 
\begin{thm*} Let $G$ be a classical Chevalley group (of normal or twisted type) of rank $n$ over a finite field.
Then $G$ equals the product of at most $200$ conjugates of $\SL_n$. \end{thm*}

It is also classically known that over arbitrary field $F$ the group $\SL(n+1, F)$, $n\geq 3$ is a product of at most $4$ subgroups of type $\SL(n, F)$.
On the other hand, from the classical Dennis---Vaserstein theorem (see~\cite{Va69} and \cite[Lemma~2.1]{ST76})
it follows that $\SL_{n+1}(R, I)$ is a product of a most $5$ subgroups of type $\SL_n(R, I)$ for any ideal $I$ satisfying $\sr(I)\leq n-1$.
Using another Dennis---Vaserstein type factorization we obtain the following result.
\begin{thm} Assume that $\sr(I) = 2$ then the group $\Spin_{2\ell}(R, I)=\G_{sc}(\rD_\ell, R, I)$ is a product of at most $C$ copies of subgroups of type $\rA_{\ell-1}$. \end{thm}

Another applications of parabolic factorizations developed in this paper are subsystem factorizations in terms of subgroups of type $\rA_1$.
The case of a finite field $R=F$ was studied by M.~Liebeck, N.~Nikolov and A.~Shalev in~\cite{NikProdDecomp}.
More precisely, for an untwisted Chevalley group it has been proved that $\G(\Phi, F)$ is a product of at most $N=5|\Phi^+|$ copies of $\SL(2, F)$.
In~\cite{VavKovSL2} N.~Vavilov and E.~Kovach noted that Bruhat decomposition immediately implies a bound of $N=3|\Phi^+|$ factors for arbitrary field $F$.
In fact, Gauss decomposition (see~\cite{Sm12}) implies a similar factorization for the elementary subgroup $\E(\Phi, R)$ with $3|\Phi^+|$ factors for arbitrary commutative ring of stable rank $1$.

\begin{thm} Let $I$ be an ideal of a commutative ring $R$ such that $\sr(R)\leq n$, where
\begin{itemize}
 \item $n=1$ and $\Phi$ is either classical or of type $\rE_\ell$;
 \item $n=2, 3$ and $\Phi$ is simply laced.
\end{itemize}
Then $\G(\Phi, R, I)$ is a product of at most $q_{n}(\Phi)$ copies of $\SL_{n+1}(R, I)$, where each $q_{n}(\Phi)$, $n=1,2,3$ is a quadratic function of $\rk(\Phi)$ given in Table~XXX.
\end{thm}

\section{Preliminaries}\label{sec:prelim}
For any collection of subsets $H_1,\ldots, H_n$ of a group $G$ we denote by $H_1\ldots H_n$ their Minkowski set-product,
i.\,e. the set consisting of arbitrary products $h_1\ldots h_n$ of elements $h_i\in H_i$. In particular, the equality
$G = H_1\cdot\ldots\cdot H_n$ means that every element $g\in G$ can be presented as a product $h_1\ldots h_n$ for $h_i\in H_i$.

\subsection{Root systems}
Let $\Pi=\{\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_l\}$ be a basis of $\Phi$. Denote by $\Phi^+$ and $\Phi^-$ subsets of positive and negative roots with respect to $\Pi$.
Denote by $m_i(\alpha)$ the coefficient of $\beta$ in the expansion of $\alpha$ in $\Pi$, i.\,e. $\alpha = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n m_i(\alpha) \alpha_i$.

A root subset $S\subseteq \Phi$ is called {\it parabolic} (resp. {\it reductive}, resp. {\it special}) if $\Phi=S \cup -S$ (resp. $S = -S$, resp. $S \cap -S=\varnothing$).
Any parabolic subset $S \subseteq \Phi$ can be decomposed into the disjoint union of its reductive and special part, i.e. 
$S = \Sigma_S \sqcup \Delta_S$, where $\Sigma_S \cap (-\Sigma_S) = \varnothing$, $\Delta_S = -\Delta_S$.

We denote by $(\alpha, \beta)$ the scalar product of roots and by $\langle \alpha, \beta\rangle$ the integer $2(\alpha, \beta)/(\alpha, \alpha)$.
Denote by $W(\Phi)$ the subgroup of isometries of $\Phi$ generated by all reflections $\sigma_\alpha$ where $\sigma_\alpha(\beta)=\beta-\langle\alpha,\beta \rangle\cdot \alpha$.
For $S\subseteq \Phi$ denote by $W(S)$ the subgroup of $W(\Phi)$ generated by $\sigma_\alpha$ for $\alpha\in S$.

Let $J\subseteq \Pi$ be a subset of simple roots. 
For a root $\beta = \sum d_i\alpha_i \in \Phi$ set $\shape(J, \beta):=\sum\limits_{i\in J}d_i \alpha_i$.
Set $$\Delta_J = \{\alpha \in \Phi \mid \shape(J, \alpha)=0\},\quad \Sigma^\pm_J = \{\alpha \in \Phi \mid \shape(J, \alpha)\in\Phi^\pm \}.$$
Clearly, $\Delta_J$ is a reductive subset of roots while $\Sigma^\pm_J$ are special subsets.
For two disjoint subsets $I, J\subseteq \Pi$ one has $\Sigma^\pm_{I \cup J} = \Sigma^\pm_I\cup\Sigma^\pm_J$ while $\Delta_{I\cup J} = \Delta_I \cap \Delta_J$.

\begin{lemma}[{\cite[Lemma~1]{ABS}}]\label{lemma:abs}
Let $\alpha, \beta \in \Sigma^\pm_J$ be two roots having the same length such that $\shape(J,\alpha)=\shape(J,\beta)\neq 0$.
Then $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are conjugate under the action of $W(\Delta_J)$.
\end{lemma}

\subsection{Chevalley groups}
Our exposition of Chevalley groups is standard and follows (...).
\textbf{TODO: Write more about Chevalley groups}

In this paper we work with irreducible representations of Chevalley groups corresponding to the highest weight
$\varpi_1$ (in the case of a classical $\Phi_l$) or $\varpi_l$ (in the case $\Phi_\ell=\rE_\ell$). 
The former are the natural vector representations of classical groups acting on free modules $V=R^n$ of dimension 
$n=\ell+1, 2\ell+1, 2\ell,2\ell$ for $\Phi=\rA_\ell,\rB_\ell,\rC_\ell,\rD_\ell$.
The latter representations have dimension $n=27, 56$ for $\ell=6,7$.

%TODO: Rewrite this using better terminology.
For a representation $\pi$ of $\G(\Phi, R)$ on $V$ we denote by $\Lambda(\pi)$ the set of weights of $\pi$ and by $V_\lambda$ the weight subspace corresponding to $\lambda\in\Lambda(\pi)$.
For any of the representations described above (with the sole exception of $(\rE_8, \varpi_8)$) all weight subspaces $V_\lambda$ are one-dimensional. 
This allows us to choose some basis $E_\pi=\{e_\lambda\}_{\lambda\in\Lambda(\pi)}$.

It will be convenient to use standard numbering for the weights of natural representations of classical groups (cp.~\cite[§1B]{St78}):
$$\begin{array}{cll}
  1,2,\ldots, \ell+1 & \text{in the case} & \Phi =\rA_\ell, \\
  1,2,\ldots \ell, 0, -\ell,\ldots, -2, -1 & \text{in the case} & \Phi =\rB_\ell, \\
  1,2,\ldots \ell, -\ell,\ldots, -2, -1 & \text{in the cases}   & \Phi =\rC_\ell, \rD_\ell. \\
\end{array}$$
For example, we write $1$ instead of $\varpi_1$, $2$ instead of $\varpi_1-\alpha_1$ etc.

For a weight $\lambda\in \Lambda(\pi)$ we denote by $(-)_\lambda\colon V\rightarrow R$ the coordinate function corresponding to $\lambda$.
In other words,  $v_\lambda$ is the coefficient of the basis vector $e_\lambda$ in the expansion of $v$ in $E_\pi$, i.e. $v=\sum_{\lambda\in \Lambda(\pi)} v_\lambda e_\lambda$.
We denote by $v^+$ the basis vector corresponding to highest weight.
For classical $\Phi$ we have $v^+=e_1$.

The following lemma is a relative version of the classical result sometimes called Chevalley---Matsumoto decomposition.
%TODO: Recheck the statement of the lemma; finish the proof.
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:Chevalley-Matsumoto}
Let $\pi$ be the fundamental representation of $\G_{sc}(\Phi, R)$ with the highest weight $\varpi_s$.
Assume that $g\in \G_{sc}(\Phi, R, I)$ is such that $(g\cdot v^+)_{\varpi\ssub{s}}=1$, then 
$g \in \U(\Sigma_s^-, I) \cdot \G_{sc}(\Delta_s, R, I) \cdot \U(\Sigma_s^+, I)$.
\end{lemma} \begin{proof}  For $I=R$ the statement of the lemma is contained in~\cite[Theorem~1.3]{St78}). \end{proof}

\subsection{Elementary subgroup}
Recall from~\cite{St78, VP} that for $\alpha\in \Phi$, $\xi\in R$ one can define certain elements $t_{\alpha}(\xi)$ of $\G_{sc}(\Phi, R)$ called {\it elementary root unipotents}.
These elements satisfy well-known Steinberg relations.
\begin{equation}\label{rel:add} t_\alpha(s) t_\alpha(t) = t_\alpha(s+t), \end{equation} 
\begin{equation}\label{rel:CCF} [t_\alpha(s),  t_\beta(t)] = \left(\prod\limits t_{i\alpha + j\beta}(N_{\alpha,\beta, i, j}s^i t^j)\right),\quad \alpha\neq-\beta, N_{\alpha, \beta, i, j}\in\mathbb{Z}.\end{equation}
The indices $i$, $j$ in the above formula range over all positive natural numbers such that $i\alpha + j\beta\in\Phi$.
The integers $N_{\alpha, \beta, i, j}$ are called {\it structure constants} of the Chevalley group $\G(\Phi,R)$ and depend only on $\Phi$.

For $\xi\in R^*$ set $w_\alpha(\xi) := x_\alpha(\xi) x_{-\alpha}(-\xi^{-1}) x_{\alpha}(\xi).$
If $\rk(\Phi)\geq 2$ the following relation is a consequence of \ref{rel:add}--\ref{rel:CCF}:
\begin{equation}\label{rel:R3} w_\alpha(\xi) t_{\beta}(s) w_\alpha(\xi)^{-1} =
t_{\sigma\ssub{\alpha}\beta} (\eta_{\alpha, \beta}\xi^{-\langle\beta,\alpha \rangle} s),\ \xi,s\in R. \end{equation}
where coefficients $\eta_{\alpha, \beta} = \pm 1$ (see~\cite[\S13]{VP} for more details on $\eta_{\alpha, \beta}$).

\begin{rem} Let $\lambda_1, \lambda_2 \in \Lambda(\pi)$ be a pair of weights of a representation $\pi$ of a classical group such that $\lambda_1-\lambda_2\in \Phi$.
In this situation it will be convenient for us to write $t_{\lambda_1,\lambda_2}(\xi)$ instead of $t_{\lambda_1-\lambda_2}(\xi)$.
For example, for $\Phi=\rA_\ell$ we have $t_{1,2}(\xi)=t_{1-2}(\xi)=t_{\varpi_1 - \varpi_1 + \alpha_1}(\xi) = t_{\alpha_1}(\xi)$. \end{rem}

Let $I\leq R$ be an ideal. Denote by $\E(\Phi, I)$ the subgroup of $\G_{sc}(\Phi, R)$ generated by elementary root unipotents $t_\alpha(\xi)$, $\alpha\in\Phi$, $\xi\in I$.
In the special case $I=R$ the subgroup $\E(\Phi, R)$ is called the {\it elementary subgroup} of the Chevalley group $\G_{sc}(\Phi, R)$.
Taddei's theorem asserts that $\E(\Phi, R)$ is a normal subgroup of $\G_{sc}(\Phi, R)$ provided $\Phi$ is an irreducible root system of rank $\geq 2$.

We denote by $\E(\Phi, R, I)$ the normal closure of $\E(\Phi, I)$ in $\E(\Phi, R)$, in other words $\E(\Phi, R, I) = \E(\Phi, I)^{\E(\Phi, R)}$.
Denote by $z_\alpha(s, \xi)$ the element $t_\alpha(s)^{t\ssub{-\alpha}(\xi)}$.
The following result of L.~Vaserstein and J.~Tits describes a set of generators of $\E(\Phi, R, I)$ (see e.\,g.~\cite[Theorem~2]{Va86}).

\begin{thm} Let $\Phi$ be an irreducible root system of rank $\geq 2$, then the relative elementary subgroup $\E(\Phi, R, I)$
is generated by elements $z_\alpha(s, \xi)$, $\alpha\in \Phi$, $s\in I$, $\xi\in R$.
\end{thm}

In fact, one can choose a more economical set of generators for $\E(\Phi, R, I)$ (see~\cite[Theorem~3.4]{S}).
\begin{thm}\label{theorem:Stepanov}
Let $\Phi$ be a reduced irreducible root system of rank $\geq 2$ and let $S$ be any parabolic subset of roots of $\Phi$ with special part $\Sigma_S$.
Then $\E(\Phi, R, I)$ is generated by the following two families of elements:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $t_{\alpha}(s)$, where $s\in I$, $\alpha\in\Phi$;
 \item $z_\alpha(s,\xi)$, where $s\in I$, $\xi\in R$, $\alpha\in\Sigma_S$. \end{itemize} \end{thm}
 
For a special subset of roots $S\subseteq \Phi$ we denote by $\U(S, I)$ the subgroup spanned by all $t_{\alpha}(s)$ for $s\in I$, $\alpha\in S$.
The subgroup $\U(\Sigma_J, I)$ is normalized by $\E(\Delta_J, R)$, hence the Minkowski product set $\EP_J(R, I) = \E(\Delta_J, R, I) \cdot \U(\Sigma_J, I)$ is a subgroup. 
The following two equalities will be referred to in the sequel as {\it Levi decomposition}: 
$$\EP_J(R, I) = \U(\Sigma_J, I) \cdot \E(\Delta_J, R, I) = \E(\Delta_J, R, I) \cdot \U(\Sigma_J, I).$$
